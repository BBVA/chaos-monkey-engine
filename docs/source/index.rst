Chaos Monkey Engine
===================

Chaos Monkey Engine is a tool designed to perform attacks against any infrastructure. The engine gives you a couple of
attacks and planners out of the box, and offers a simple interface to create your own.

The engine uses `Apache Libcloud <https://libcloud.apache.org/>`_ to access cloud providers
and the AWS driver is implemented out of the box (check the :ref:`extending` section if you want to create your own
driver).

The Chaos Monkey Engine also exposes an API to manage attacks and planners.

If you are in a hurry, try the :ref:`quickstart` to see it in action. If you want to know more, jump to :ref:`overview`.
